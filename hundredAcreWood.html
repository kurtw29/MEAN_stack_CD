    <h2>Hundred Acre Wood Map - Where will you go?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Type the direction "north", "south", "east", or "west" in the input area</li>
        <li>You can chain the moving direction by using "." eg) north.south --> go "north" and then go "south"</li>
        <li>Another example: north.south.west --> go "north" then "south" then "west"</li>
    <h4> Have fun!</h4>
